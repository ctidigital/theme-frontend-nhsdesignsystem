/// To Maintain Aspect ratio to fit content

/// Usage: @include aspect-ratio(16,9);

/// @include aspect-ratio(1.777777778);
///
/// Limitation: If the element with the aspect ratio applied has display:flex;, it wonâ€™t work in FF.
/// Fix: Use flex in new div rather than on the aspect ratio mixin itself.
